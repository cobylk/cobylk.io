A tidal disruption event is an astronomical event where a star passes by a supermassive black hole. The star is drawn in and loops around the black hole. Because of the immense gravity of the blackhole, the star is ripped apart and stretches into a disk of material surrounding the black hole, which is gradually consumed over months or years.
