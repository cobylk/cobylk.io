### Hey there!
My name is Coby, and I'm a student researcher with interest in mechanistic interpretability and a broader interest in most things related to technical AI safety and alignment. In my free time, I love composing and performing classical music, hiking, and skiing.

I'm starting my undergrad  [this fall](tooltip:Yes, 2025.) at (coming soon).

### Construction zone!
This website is very much in progress, and I plan to write much more and flesh things out in the somewhat near future. In the meantime, check out (what I have added so far) of my [research](Research), [music](Music), or personal [thoughts](Personal).

### Random stuff
In lieu of [actual content](tooltip:which takes time and effort to produce) (for the time being), I decided that the below would be better than more blankness. 

Here is a panoramic view I captured from the top of [Quandary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quandary_Peak).

This is the [best animal](fav_animals). Because of their diet, bamboo lemurs are practically immune to cyanide.
