### Hey there!
My name is Coby, and I'm a student researcher with interest in mechanistic interpretability and a broader interest in most things related to technical AI safety and alignment. In my free time, I love composing and [performing classical music](tooltip:My primary instrument is the piano, though I played saxophone somewhat well and have unsuccessfully tried to learn the violin on several ocassions.), hiking, and skiing. I'm starting my undergrad  [this fall](tooltip:Yes, 2025.) at (coming soon).

Check out my... 
- [research projects](Research)
- [compositions and performances](Music)
- [personal things](Personal)

(or at least, what I have added so far of them)

> [!danger]-  Danger: Construction Zone!
> This website is very much so in progress. I plan to write much more, flesh things out, and fix things in the near future. Forgive me if you encounter anything that is buggy or incomplete.

### Random stuff
In lieu of [actual content](tooltip:Which would take lots of time and effort to produce) (for the time being), I decided that the below would be better than more blankness. 

Here is a panoramic view I captured from the top of [Quandary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quandary_Peak).

This is the [best animal](fav_animals). Because of their diet, bamboo lemurs are practically immune to cyanide.
