- Introduction
	- A child is dawdling along a street when a man aggressively approaches and begins describing a convoluted argument. The child, startled, freezes and listens to the man. He discusses empirical evidence and elucidates a mathematical model at length, and he complains that because of this, he is forcefully led to the conclusion that the child will die of cancer in the next few years. The child ponders for a moment and declares "I will pursue a career as a cancer researcher and cure myself!"
- Trying to predict the future: TAI timelines and outcomes
	- The feasibility of vast superintelligence, the necessity of general intelligence for nontrivial research automation, and the generality of LLMs.
	- Scenario timings
		- Scaling
		- Plateau scenarios
		- Alternatives to scaling LMs; alternative timelines
	- **An enumeration of scenarios including timing and capability, weighted by probability**
- Outcomes by capability
	- Takeover
	- Value lock-in
- The meaning of life
	- I am not a utilitarian
