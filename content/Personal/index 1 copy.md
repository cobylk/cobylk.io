Hello my name is Coby Kassner. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet asdfkj asfkdj sajkdf .

## This is a header.
Why am I solving the below integral? I don't know.
$$
\begin{align*}
    \int x^{x} dx
\end{align*}
$$
Now that we've stated the problem, have a codeblock!
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    # wow!
```
That was really cool.
